This is my fifth project for the Team Treehouse Full Stack tech degree.
This app uses fetch to get user information for a fictional start up. 
With the  use of the API 12 fictional employees are displayed and when their name card 
is clicked a modal displays more information. The modals can be used to look through different
employees.
There is also a search function that that allows the user to seach through the 12 employess.
If there are no search results a message stating so appears.
I made the following changes to the css styling
1. background- I got a new background image from https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/
2. Changed the the card background and text colors(for on hoover as well)
3. Changed the font for the h1 text.
4. Changed the background, buttons (including close button), text color, borders for the modal.
5. All the user images are also lego heads because I thought it would make the project more fun.
In the future I would like to update this app by getting more than 12 users and adding some pagination.
